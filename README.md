[![CI status](https://github.com/puckel/docker-airflow/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/puckel/docker-airflow/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush)
[![Docker Build status](https://img.shields.io/docker/build/puckel/docker-airflow?style=plastic)](https://hub.docker.com/r/puckel/docker-airflow/tags?ordering=last_updated).

I added some tweak to the repository considering the dependencies was upgraded. I spent sometime researching how to downgrade the dependencies using the Dockerfile. We wouldn't be pulling the container from docker hub. Instead, we will be building it from the repository. 

This repository contains **Dockerfile** of [docker-airflow](https://github.com/puckel/docker-airflow) by Puckel and [Airflow tutorial](https://github.com/tuanavu/airflow-tutorial) by Tuan Vu. Puck [automated build](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/puckel/docker-airflow/). Puckel published to the public [Docker Hub Registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com/).

## Informations

* Based on Python (3.7-slim-buster) official Image [python:3.7-slim-buster](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/) and uses the official [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) as backend and [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) as queue
* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* Following the Airflow release from [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/apache-airflow)


## Build

Optionally install [Extra Airflow Packages](https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/installation.html#extra-package) and/or python dependencies at build time :

    docker build --rm --build-arg AIRFLOW_DEPS="gcp" -t puckel/docker-airflow-dev .


Don't forget to update the airflow images in the docker-compose files to puckel/docker-airflow:latest.

## Usage

By default, docker-airflow runs Airflow with **SequentialExecutor** :

    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 puckel/docker-airflow-dev webserver

If you want to run another executor, use the other docker-compose.yml files provided in this repository.

For **LocalExecutor** :

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-LocalExecutor.yml up -d

For **CeleryExecutor** :

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-CeleryExecutor.yml up -d

NB : If you want to have DAGs example loaded (default=False), you've to set the following environment variable :

`LOAD_EX=n`

    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e LOAD_EX=y puckel/docker-airflow-dev

If you want to use Ad hoc query, make sure you've configured connections:
Go to Admin -> Connections and Edit "postgres_default" set this values (equivalent to values in airflow.cfg/docker-compose*.yml) :
- Host : postgres
- Schema : airflow
- Login : airflow
- Password : airflow
